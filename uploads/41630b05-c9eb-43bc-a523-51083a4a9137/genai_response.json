  "problemStatement": "You're managing a critical rescue mission where `N` people need to be evacuated from a sinking ship. You have an unlimited supply of rescue pods, each with a fixed weight `limit`. Each pod can carry at most two people. To minimize the total number of pods used and thus streamline the rescue, you must assign people efficiently. If a pod carries two people, their combined weight cannot exceed the `limit`. If a pod carries only one person, that person's weight must not exceed the `limit` (which is always true if they are to be saved).\n\nGiven an array `weights`, where `weights[i]` is the weight of the i-th person, and an integer `limit`, determine the minimum number of rescue pods required to save all `N` people.",
  "inputFormat": "The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of people.\nThe second line contains `N` space-separated integers, representing the `weights` of the people.\nThe third line contains an integer `limit`, the maximum weight capacity of a single rescue pod.",
